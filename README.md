Languages used: HTML, CSS, Javacsript

The purpose for this project was to practice my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. As well as get familiar accessing API's. 

- Allows users to input a url of their choosing in order to obtain a QR code for that url.
- Once the url is entered, the user can select the color, size, margins, and image format they want the QR coede to be.
- A random QR code is generated from an API of different QR codes.
- The resulting QR codes are fully functional and will take the user to the url specified in the input.
